Module 6: Implementing a practical Terraform Use Case
12/15/2022
Objective
In this final module, you will gain hands on experience with Terraform by building a solution to a practical use case.

Scenario
A "cloud landing zone" is a fully operational cloud environment that is ready to host applications that have either been migrated from other places (on-premises, other cloud providers) or are new cloud native applications. 
The landing zone often includes core services including compute, storage and networking resources, as well as appropriate configuration of these services. 
This exercise works through the creation of a small landing zone that will offer Azure App Service and Azure Container Instance for compute services, and an Azure VNET for network integration of the compute resources.

Task 1: Build your Terraform Modules
Develop Terraform modules that will be the building blocks of your landing zone.

Azure VNET
azurerm_virtual_network
The VNET should contain the following:
A subnet delegated to Azure Container Instance (ACI)
A subnet for Azure Application Gateway (minimum /24)
A subnet for Private Endpoints (enforce_private_link_endpoint_network_policies = false)
A subnet delegated to Microsoft.Web/serverFarms for App Service

Azure App Service
azurerm_linux_web_app
The App Service should include the following:
Deploy an App Service Plan alongside the web app azurerm_app_service_plan
Use "Managed Identity"
Allow anonymous access.
Enable TLS 1.2 and require HTTPS
Add regional VNET integration
Deploy a private DNS zone for App Services and link it to the VNET azurerm_private_dns_zone
Create a Private Endpoint for the App Service azurerm_private_endpoint

Azure Container Instances
azurerm_container_group
The Container Instances deployment should reflect the following characteristics:
Os_type = Linux
Create a NIC and reference it in the Network_profile_Id
Use the Microsoft 'hello world' image in your deployment to verify
mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld:latest

Use your modules to build the landing zone
Build the landing zone shown above from the Terraform modules you've just built. 
You may notice that the landing zone reference above contains additional "supporting" resources including an Azure Application Gateway.
Do your best to include these resources in your deployment.

Extending landing zone
If you are successfully deploy the landing zone, extend your learning by enhancing the landing zone. 
Try taking advantage of the reusability of Terraform to quickly role out another region, and add a DNS based load balancer like Azure Traffic Manager to send traffic to both regions.

Try to avoid creating two separate Terraform configurations for the different regions - instead keep your configuration modular so that the same configuration can be used by simply changing variable values
